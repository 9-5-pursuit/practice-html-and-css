# Let's Practice Using HTML & CSS

Hey there! We've got a super cool repository that's gonna help you improve your HTML and CSS skills in a jiffy! This repository is packed with images of websites and web components that you can recreate using HTML and CSS. We've even thrown in an `index.html` and `styles.css` file to get you started! 

This hands-on practice will give you the confidence to take on any web development challenge that comes your way. So, what are you waiting for? Let's get coding and level up your web development skills!

## Let's Get Started

1. Fork this repository by clicking the _**fork**_ button on the top right of this github page.

1. Clone your forked version to your computer.

1. `cd` into the newly cloned folder then open with Visual Studio Code with `code .`

## Breaking Down Your Assets

Each practice folder contains the following folder and file structure:

- `designs/` - These are images of the site or component you're trying to replicate. Some problems include active states as well.
- `images/` - Any images you'll need for the layouts are found in here. 
- `style-guide.md` - The style guide provides color codes, font links, and anything else you may need to help match the layout.
- `index.html` - All of your HTML should be contained in this file.
- `styles.css` - All of your CSS should be contained in this file. 

## Directions

Use your knowledge of HTML and CSS to build a website or web component that closely resembles the images provided in each practice folder.

Your code should adhere to a few rules:

1. Use semantic HTML tags. [Semantic HTML Guide](https://www.semrush.com/blog/semantic-html5-guide/)

1. Control your layout with the power of `CSS Grid`. [CSS Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

1. Use `flexbox` to help with centering and spacing content evenly. [CSS Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

1. Choose to start mobile-first or desktop-first and stick with that concept for the entire problem.

1. Use `@media` queries to make changes across multiple screen sizes.

1. Keep `accessibility` in mind by making sure images have alt tags. 

## Responsiveness

Consider me your product owner. I've decided we're going to account for mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts. Here are your dimensions:

### Mobile First
- Mobile: `Default`
- Tablet: `>= 768px`
- Desktop: `>= 1280px`

### Desktop First
- Mobile: `<= 767px`
- Tablet: `<= 1279px`
- Desktop: `Default`
